<p>Takumi Fujiwara is the protagonist in the anime, Initial D. Initial D is
  about a highschool student who doesn't really care for street racing. Little
   did he know, his father, Bunta Fujiwara, was a legend on the downhill Akina
   roads. His family owns one car though it isn't even a street racing car. the
    car is a Toyota ae86 Trueno. </p>

<p>Bunta owns a tofu shop called, Fujiwara Tofu Shop. The Trueno the family owns
is used to make tofu deliveries.Takumi is usually the person who does the
deliveries. He was trained by Bunta to drive the car with maximum efficiency,
but actually, he was trained to race the car through the Akina downhill. The way
Takumi drives is like a street racer but he never even thought of it like that.
 he later on goes down the path of street racing  with his little 86
 Trueno facing up against opponents that have cars that are actually built for
  street racing.</p>
